      <h3> What is carbon footprint? </h3>
      <p> &raquo; Carbon footprint is the amount of CO2 released into the atmosphere because of one's own energy needs. It includes carbon dioxide — the gas most commonly emitted by humans — and others, including methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases, which trap heat in the atmosphere, causing global warming.</p>
      <br><br>

      <h3> Why should we reduce our carbon footprint? </h3>
      <p> &raquo; Large carbon footprints deplete resources on large and small scales, from a country’s deforestation activities to one home’s increased use of air conditioning. The more those with large carbon footprints use resources, the more greenhouse gases increase and spur further climate change.</p>
      <p> &raquo; Some consequences of large carbon footprints include shrinking water supplies, increasing incidents of severe weather, changes in food supply, and large geographical changes.</p>
      <br><br>
      
      <h3> How will emission help? </h3>
      <p> &raquo; Emission will help you track your daily, weekly, monthly, and annual carbon footprint. By using various data sources, the surveys and questions the user answers will affect their "sustainability score." By allowing users to add friends and family and thus enabling them to see each other's sustainability score, emission helps keep you and your friends accountable while encouraging a little healthy competition.</p>
